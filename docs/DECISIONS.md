# Decisions

## Conversation routing

- **Decision:** Every live typed message and every voice transcript goes through the same intent-understanding step. Only `scheme_question` may retrieve passages; its query is requested in English and skips legacy query translation.
- **Alternatives considered:** Keep a deterministic greeting classifier in front of RAG; translate non-English input in the RAG module; continue retrieving for all messages.
- **Why:** The model must distinguish clarifications and social messages before retrieval. The explicit English query prevents duplicate translation and improves search consistency.

## Session history and caching

- **Decision:** Live chat uses process-local six-turn history capped at 500 LRU sessions. The old answer cache remains on the mocked chat path; live turns are not served from the answer cache.
- **Alternatives considered:** Cache live results by question; cache only grounded answers; move memory into shared storage.
- **Why:** A repeated utterance can be a clarification whose meaning depends on the previous assistant answer. Caching before intent understanding can return a scheme result for a clarification. Shared durable memory is outside this demo's scope.

## Dialect confidence

- **Decision:** A user-confirmed dialect is always passed as a hint. Automatic dialect output is passed only when the existing repo classifier marks it high confidence; medium results and abstentions do not override language understanding.
- **Alternatives considered:** Pass medium-confidence labels; disable all automatic dialect hints.
- **Why:** The classifier's confidence is not calibrated for production. A user confirmation is stronger evidence, and the repo already treats medium confidence conservatively.

## Server-side TTS

- **Decision:** Gemini TTS may be implemented using the current official speech-generation documentation and the selected model must be configured by environment. Bhashini/Dhruva remains behind an adapter until its live pipeline callback URL, auth header, selected TTS pipeline, payload and response are confirmed from the owner's account.
- **Alternatives considered:** Hardcode a public example endpoint or model/service id; implement only browser speech.
- **Why:** Bhashini's official docs say compute endpoint and auth header are returned by a per-account pipeline config call; they do not supply a safe universal default. No guessed request shape or endpoint will be shipped.

## Scheme data

- **Decision:** Do not modify scheme data unless an official government source is fetched and its details can be verified. Preserve any unverified or sample-marked text and list it for human review.
- **Alternatives considered:** Fill gaps from prior knowledge; infer details from third-party summaries.
- **Why:** Eligibility, amounts, dates and links affect citizens and must be traceable to official sources.
