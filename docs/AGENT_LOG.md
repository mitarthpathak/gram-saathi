# Agent work log

## Phase 0 — recon

- Files changed: `docs/AGENT_NOTES.md`, `docs/AGENT_LOG.md`.
- Commands run: `npm install` (PowerShell policy rejected `npm.ps1`); `npm.cmd install` (failed with EPERM opening the user npm cache; approval request was made); `npm.cmd run typecheck`; `npm.cmd run lint`; `npm.cmd test --workspaces --if-present`; `npm.cmd run build`.
- Results: typecheck passed; lint could not start because `eslint` is not recognized (dependencies likely incomplete); 131/134 tests passed, with 3 existing eligibility tests failing because all rules are unverified; build passed. No code changes were made during recon.
- Open issues: npm install/cache approval result needs checking; working tree had uncommitted edits before work began and they are being preserved. Git branch `feat/conversation-layer` created from current HEAD.

## Phase 1 — conversation module

- Files changed: `server/src/modules/chat/conversation.ts`, `server/test/conversation.test.ts`.
- Commands run: `npm.cmd run typecheck`; `npm.cmd test -w server -- --run test/conversation.test.ts`; `npm.cmd run build`; `npm.cmd run lint`.
- Results: intent-first routing returns direct responses without search for non-scheme intents, uses English standalone search text for scheme questions, filters passages by score, and accepts only returned passage ids. Empty non-scheme replies now return notFound. Session history is capped at 6 turns and 500 LRU sessions.
- Results: final verification passed: typecheck, lint with no diagnostics, focused conversation suite (10/10), and workspace build. The npm install retry completed without changing the lockfile.
- Open issues: none for this phase.
